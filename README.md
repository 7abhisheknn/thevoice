I Abhishek N N (20BCE1025) built a Speech To Text Flutter app which recognizes & analyzes words to execute commands as a project for <a href="https://androidclubvit.com/">Android Club VIT Chennai website</a>.

This is flutter app 
using 
-  speech_to_text: ^5.5.0
-  avatar_glow: ^2.0.2
-  url_launcher: ^6.1.2
-  clipboard: ^0.1.3
-  share_plus: ^4.0.4

form pub.dev

## Running procedure
- install flutter
- dowload repo (this project)
- update pubspec.yaml and dependencies
- run flutter project

## Development Journey and chalenges
- Firstly <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/sdk/releases">flutter sdk 3.0 </a> released 12/05/2022 and with android api 31 and above so i had to redo and update in may sections
- I leart many to things about speech_to_text to implement this project
- for other plugins I firstly tried to implement on my own then used pakages to speed up the work flow 
- The git tutorials from android club were very useful while I did something wrong in project and sort of timeTraveled (codeTraveled) back to right ones
- finaly integration all the things with beautiful ui took more time than expected but Android club's videos and guidance helped out at the end.
